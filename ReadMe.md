S370
====

This is a port to Go of my simH based IBM360/370 emulator. Eventually this will emulate just a IBM 370. 

Currently, the emulator is passing CPU diagnostics, except for errors related to differences between 360 and 370. Channel diagnostics still has errors.

Current devices supported are 1052 console, 2540 reader/punch, 2400 tape drives.

The devices supported should be same as simH 360/370 emulator.
